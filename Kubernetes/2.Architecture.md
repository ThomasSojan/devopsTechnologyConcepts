# Kubernetes Concepts
## K8s Architecture

### Worker Nodes

-> Nodes which multiple application pods are running on it<br>
-> It has three main processes installed to schedule and manage those pods<br>
-> First process is a **container runtime** like docker,podman etc<br>
-> Second is **Kubelet** that interact with both container and nodes<br>
-> Kubelet responsible for starting a pod with container inside and assigning resources from that node to the container like cpu, ram and storage resources<br>
-> Third process is **Kube-Proxy** which is responsible for forwarding the requests from services to pods<br>
-> Kube-Proxy has intelligent logic inside that make sure the communication takes place with low overhead<br>
-> For Ex if an application makes a request to database, instead of service forward randomly the request to any replica it will forward it to the replica that is running on the same node where the pod that create the request is running thus network overhead is avoided


### Master Nodes

-> Master node control the cluster state and worker nodes<br>
-> 4 processes run on every master node<br>
-> First one is **API Server** it is like a cluster gateway which accepts commands from kubctl clients or K8 GUI <br>
-> It also act like a gatekeeper meaning it validate or authenticate the request before forwarding it to other proceses<br>
-> Another master process is **Scheduler** it will decide on which node new pods to be scheduled based on the cluster node resourse availability<br>
-> The Kubelet process in worker node get request from Scheduler<br>
-> Third one is **Controller Manager** it detects state changes like crashing of pods for example<br>
-> When a pod died the controller manager detects the state and tries to recover the state by spinning up the pod<br>
-> For that the controller manager make request to scheduler, based on the resource availability scheduler target a node and schedule the pod via kubelet<br>
-> The fourth master process is **etcd**, it is a key value store of a cluster state<br>
-> etcd is the cluster brain because every changes in the cluster got saved in the key value-store<br>
-> etcd contain all the information about the cluster such as cluster health(for api server), available resources(for scheduler), cluster state change(for controller manager)<br>
