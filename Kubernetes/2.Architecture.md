# Kubernetes Concepts
## K8s Architecture

### Worker Nodes

-> Nodes which multiple application pods are running on it<br>
-> It has three main processes installed to schedule and manage those pods<br>
-> First process is a **container runtime** like docker,podman etc<br>
-> Second is **Kubelet** that interact with both container and nodes<br>
-> Kubelet responsible for starting a pod with container inside and assigning resources from that node to the container like cpu, ram and storage resources<br>
-> Third process is **Kube-Proxy** which is responsible for forwarding the requests from services to pods<br>
-> Kube-Proxy has intelligent logic inside that make sure the communication takes place with low overhead<br>
-> For Ex if an application makes a request to database instead of service forward randomly the request to any replica it will forward it to the replica that is running on the same node to avoid network overhead
