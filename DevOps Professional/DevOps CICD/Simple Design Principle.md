# Simple Design Principle
Help in maintenance of code and ensure that it integrates well and lends itself to changes.

## What are the principles?
* Pass all the tests
* Reveal the intention
* Not contain duplication
* Have the fewest of the elements

## How can they be implemented?
**Refactoring** help in ensuring there is no duplication and code reveals the intent of the programmer ,is simple and ensure that there is
no lazy code(ensure fewest of the elements). **Test automation** helps in ensuring code passes all the tests.

## Practical tips
* Use static code analyzer tools with rules designed to ensure that the simple design principles are followed 
* Simple design should not be confused as simplistic design or design phase in Agile
* These principles should be inculcated as a habit rather than rules
