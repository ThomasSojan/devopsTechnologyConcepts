# Build Automation

## Steps involved:
* Getting the latest version of the program files from Configuration Server

* Compiling the programs

* Performing Static analysis on the programs/code to get feedback on design

* Running automated test (Unit/System test cases)

* Collecting Metrics on Code Coverage of each program during Unit Testing

* Packaging the programs into some form of binaries like .war or .jar or .ear files

* Placing the binary file into a central repository from where the SIT or UAT team can pick up for deployment and testing.
