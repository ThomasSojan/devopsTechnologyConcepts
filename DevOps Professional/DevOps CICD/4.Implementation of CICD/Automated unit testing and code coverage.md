## Automated Code Coverage ensures


* Provides quantitative measurement of testing effort

* Indicates redundancy in test cases

* Increased code coverage may lead to early defect detection

* Points to untested areas of code

* Code coverage does not imply that the code is bug free, it means that the code is completely tested (if tests are flaky code coverage cannot help)

## Popular tools for unit testing

* JUnit

* NUnit

* MSTest 

## Popular tools for code coverage

* Cobertura

* Emma

* JaCoCo

## Practical tips

* Separate common set up and teardown logic into test support services utilized by the appropriate test cases.

* Test code to be treated on par with production/source code.

* Review of test cases is also mandatory.

* Avoid slow running tests.

* Unit tests are so named because they each test one unit of code.

* Developers to run the entire suite.

* Use mock objects.

* When Test Driven Development is used along with test automation, the results are impressive.
