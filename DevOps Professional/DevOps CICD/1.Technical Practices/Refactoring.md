# Refactoring
The process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code, yet improves its internal structure
## Practical tips
* Buffer time for refactoring every sprint
* Do not refactor very close to release
* You may refactor code that is being newly developed rather than already existing code (legacy code)
* Sensitize customers on the need for time to be allocated for refactoring
