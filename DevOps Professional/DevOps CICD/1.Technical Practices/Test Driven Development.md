# Test Driven Development (TDD)
Is a software engineering approach that involves short development iterations consists of writing failing test case(s) first covering a new functionality and then implementing the necessary code to pass the tests and finally refactor the code without changing external behavior. 

## Need
* Increased Code coverage
* Reduced duplication/redundancy
* Better consideration of reusability & design
* Modular and Stable Code

## How it is done?
**1.** Select new feature<br>
**2.** Write a test case<br>
**3.** Run test to fail<br>
**4.** Write enough code to pass the tests<br>
**5.** Run test to pass<br>
**6.** Refactor the code and tests<br>

**XUnit** frameworks help in writing automated unit tests. Thus TDD includes both **test automation** and **refactoring**.

## Practical tips:
* TDD takes 1.5 times more time than normal development, however helps in reduction of defects and produces good quality code
* May start with few modules and do pair programming with a tester and programmer
* Automated unit test cases help in implementing TDD
