# Pair Programming
Two programmers coding together on a single machine is called pair programming. One of the programmer plays the role of a driver who writes clean code, compiles and execute the code. The other plays the role of navigator who strategizes on design, tests, reviews and refactors code. These pairs self-organize and switch partners and roles during the day
## Practical Tips
* Pairing can be done on code which is to be maintained
* Switching partners several times during the day helps
* Form natural pairs, no enforcement
* Allow lot of conversation
* Switch driver and navigator roles
* Good infrastructure for pairing stations
* Maintaining peer balance during pairing is essential (Pairing of senior and junior developers)
