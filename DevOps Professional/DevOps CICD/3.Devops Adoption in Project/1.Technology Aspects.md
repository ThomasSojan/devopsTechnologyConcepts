* **Continuous Integration(CI)-** is a software development practice adopted as part of extreme programming (XP). It helps in automating the build process, enabling frequent integration, code quality checks and unit testing without any manual intervention by use of various open-source, custom-built and/or licensed tools
* **Continuous Delivery(CD)-** is a software development process to automate and promote the builds through higher environments, performing incremental validation and verifying the production readiness through the usage of appropriate tool sets. It is an extension to Continuous Integration (CI)
* Automated monitoring and support
