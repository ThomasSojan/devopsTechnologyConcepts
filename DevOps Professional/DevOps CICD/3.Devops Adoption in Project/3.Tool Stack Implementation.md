# Tool stack and its implementation
## Principles to be considered
* **Repeatability :** The automated pipeline needs to be executed frequently and multiple times with consistency
* **Reliability :** The automated pipeline should ensure reliable software
* **End to end automation :** The activities from coding to release should be automated
* **100% source control :** All the artifacts involved in the pipeline need to be version controlled (ex. Source code, automated test cases, reports, binaries etc.)
* **Auto build quality :** Pipeline should have quality auto-built by way of gating conditions
* **Done is released :** Pipeline should ensure that “done-ness” as per the definition of done is only released to production
* **Continuous feedback :** Tools provide continuous feedback by way of reports
* **Customer appetite for tooling :** The availability of budget from customer, existing tools and alliances, technology used in the project, feasibility of automation
